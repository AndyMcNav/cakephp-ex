			<em class="p1">If I am being more specific, I live in West London.</em>
		<p>
			<em class="p2">There is a lot of greenery and parks around where I live. It is a very good place
			to go on walks.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em class="p2">There are many great restaraunts as well, one of the best Korean places in London is a
			very short walk from where I live. </em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em class="p2">I'm not sure why we ran with these colour choices but ok, if you like stuff to do
			like cinema's or activities you are in the wrong place but the train station can take you into central.
